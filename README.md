## How to use this?
Just clone the repository, build it using visual studio or using `dotnet build` and open the executable. Then download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) and put it in the same directory as the executable and run. Put your videos in, select your output type, right click to remove a video, etc, etc.

## Misc.
I am not responsible if somehow YouTube finds out you are using this tool and terminates this channel. This was made possible with [YouTube.Explode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) library and [YouTubeExplode.Converter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode.Converter) library.
